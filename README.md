# stem_filter

This is a simple but hugely time-saving Python PyQt GUI program used by the Project Management department intended to quicken the due dilligence process for screening a large number of name candidates to determine if there are any INN generic stems conflicts within the names.

This program allows a user to input a list of names and builds an excel document outlining any/all conflicts with each name

The main window uses a fairly simple UI; the output is an excel file showing INN stem conflicts
